business objectives for this, such as:\n","\n","* **Price Prediction**: Model car prices based on features like mileage, fuel type, and performance.\n","* **Market Analysis**: Explore trends and preferences in the used car market, by type, region, or other metrics.\n","* **Feature Importance**: Identify the most important factors influencing car prices (e.g., fuel type, mileage,
